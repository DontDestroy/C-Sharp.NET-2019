# C-Sharp.NET-2019
Copy Paste Classroom

Hello all,

This list of zipped examples are the latest versions of the examples seen in the courses of Visual Studio C#.NET 2019 / 2022 and later.

When you download examples, please find out how to switch off the "blocked access" in Windows 10/11.
- Click on the zip files with the other button.
- Unblock the access to the file.
- Then unzip (the default zip of Windows is used).

Every week, examples are changed or added, depending on the progress of Vincent, who is busy to document all the stuff he has on the subject.
This is a growing organisme :-), meaning, it is never finished.

Proposals, questions, remarks or even found errors can be sent towards Vincent@CopyPaste.be or phone 0475/97.63.80
- You are a contributor, but don't change the content of this repository.
- There is also a discussion page created for this repository, you can also place remarks there.

Enjoy
Vincent Van De Walle
